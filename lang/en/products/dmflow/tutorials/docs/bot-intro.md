# Bot Introduction

The chatbot section includes dialogue flow, logs, publishing, and settings.

In the dialogue flow, you can design and configure the flow and logic of conversations. The log feature is used to record and track the history and statistical data of conversations. The publishing feature is used to deploy and release the chatbot to different branches. The settings section provides relevant configurations such as time zone, URL whitelist, and other chatbot settings.

The combination of these features makes chatbot development and management more convenient and flexible, allowing you to easily design, track, and adjust your conversational chatbot.

## Template

Two templates are provided: dialogue templates and memory templates.

- Dialogue templates: Used to connect dialogue replies from other platforms to achieve multi-channel conversational interactions.
- Memory templates: Used to store permanent or temporary information for later use or referencing.

The common response feature also offers various prompts such as flow errors, welcome reminders, flow updates, busy responses, and unmatched inputs to enhance the interactivity and user experience of conversations.

- Increased coverage: Through broadcasting, you can deliver messages to a large number of users, increasing the coverage and visibility of your messages. This helps in promoting activities, new product releases, or conveying important announcements.

- Remarketing and promotion: Broadcasting is a powerful tool for remarketing where you can send relevant offers, promotions, or important messages to users who have previously shown interest, thus increasing user conversion rates and engagement.

- Important notifications and updates: Broadcasting can also be used to send important notifications and updates, such as system changes, service interruption notices, or policy updates. This ensures that users are informed about the latest information and provided with necessary guidance.
