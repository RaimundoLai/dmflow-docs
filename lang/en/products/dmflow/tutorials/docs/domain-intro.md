# Domain Introduction

The DmFlow domain is defined as a choice among Q&A pairs, table Q&A, or intent creation. It provides various rich functionalities that can be utilized by Q&A pairs, table Q&A, and intent invocation.

## Intents

Intents are categorized into the following four types:

- Intent Identification: Using machine learning and natural language processing techniques, it analyzes and understands the user's input dialogue to identify their intentions. This helps the chatbot quickly grasp user requirements and provide appropriate responses or perform corresponding actions based on specific intentions.

- Intent Classification: With a predefined intent classification system, it categorizes user intentions into specific classes or categories. This helps organize and manage different intents and set corresponding responses or processing flows for each intent.

- Intent Training and Optimization: It provides functionalities for intent training and optimization to further improve the accuracy and performance of intent identification. Through feedback and corrections, users can continuously enhance the chatbot's ability to recognize intentions, making it better adapted to different user needs and contexts.

- Intent Management: Allows users to manage intents, including adding, modifying, and deleting intents. This enables users to define and adjust intents based on actual requirements and business changes, ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the chatbot dialogue.

In summary, the intent functionalities enable the chatbot to understand user intentions and provide appropriate responses based on specific goals or needs. This enhances the conversational experience, delivers more accurate answers, and makes the chatbot more intelligent and capable of human-like conversations.

## Q&A Pairs

1. In the Q&A pairs domain, resource API integration is provided, allowing the integration of external data to generate answers for the Q&A pairs.


## Logs

### Historical Records

Historical records are used to log the conversation content of the "production version" and provide labels to assist in understanding the shortcomings of the domain and further improve and optimize the conversation flow.

Here are the labels for each section and their corresponding meanings:

Intent Type:
- all: Display all conversations
- none: Conversations without labels
- isIntent: Conversations triggering intents
- slotFilled: Conversations filling slot values
- fallback: Conversations that did not match any intents.

Q&A Pairs:
- all: Display all conversations
- none: Conversations without labels
- fallback: Conversations that did not match any Q&A pairs.

This historical record functionality allows you to conveniently view conversations under specific labels and further analyze and improve the performance of the chatbot.
